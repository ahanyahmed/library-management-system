Basic library management system using JAVA language with OOP
As part of my Programming 2 course, I created a Java-based
library management system that applied object-oriented
principles and featured separate text file databases for
librarians and books, a user-friendly Java GUI for easy data
retrieval and modification, and password-protected database
modification for enhanced data security.
